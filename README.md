# Monograph-of-Program-Analysis-for-Understanding-and-Reverse-Engineering-of-Network-Protocols

Comparing between the the various state-of-the-art reverse engineering tools
- Analyzed the current state of reverse engineering in the domain of network engineering and evaluated several research
papers on the topic.
- We first started with the manual reverse engineering techniques which soon were replaced with automatic
implementations.
- We also briefly discussed the difference between network-traffic based automatic protocol reverse engineering techniques
and application-level-based automatic reverse engineering techniques.)
